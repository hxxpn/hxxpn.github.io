# Engineering, research, vibes and math

Hello, I am a lifelong student, currently working towards a PhD in Telecommunications engineering. 
During the day I am a software engineer, mostly distributed backend systems for enterprise.

I believe in sharing knowledge and experiences, this is how we create a new generation
of thinkers and creators. That's why this blog exists!

Besides my sharing my explorations I will also share projects, tips and best practices
for general, everyday software engineering. Trying to form a concise argument about some design pattern
or architectural decision will force you to revisit it in hte most meaningful way.

I am learning about ML/DeepLearning, Information Theory, Digital Image Processing,
Signal Processing, Distributed Systems for Multimedia Processing, and a lot of interesting math.
