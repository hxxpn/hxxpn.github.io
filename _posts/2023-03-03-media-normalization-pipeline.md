# Media Normalization pipeline for ML purposes


## Motivation

Today there is a great need for cleansed and annotated training data for various ML applications.
Video and audio material might be the most cumbersome and the most difficult to handle. It would be
good to have a way to quickly transform a bulk of A/V data to a format that is required for a model.

Most material doesn't come in the same CODEC, resolution, bitrate, framerate etc. so in order to have
a database that fits your training process you need to perform various transformations one by one, plus there is upscaling/downscaling that needs to be addressed.
