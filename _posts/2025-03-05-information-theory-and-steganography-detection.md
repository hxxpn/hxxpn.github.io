# Information theory and Steganography detection


I am currently studying information theory. In the spirit of the field I immediately started thinking
bout unconventional communication channels. Like digital images, videos and even books.

It turns out that there are a bunch of ways to 'hide' information in images. Some
obvious to detect, some a little less obvious. How would we rate these attempts at hiding information?

We can rank them based on difficulty of retrieval, or resistance to tampering or even the capacity of each method.


## Lumen code detector

This is one weapon in the massive arsenal of fictive Lumen corporation, from the series Severance. 
In the elevators between the floors there are 'code-detectors'. They ensure that no information is being passed
in or out of the severed floor. It can detect codes, papers with written messages, broken up messages that can be assembled etc.
Now, even in the Severance reality, this elevator might be closely guarded and monitored area and no automation actually
occurs. Either way it is an interesting problem to tackle.

Given a message, of any content, how can you tell it carries meaningful but hidden information?

How would you implement something like a code detector? How do you know a message/object carries information 
that is hidden?
