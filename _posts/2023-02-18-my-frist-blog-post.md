## My first blog post

### What's this blog all about?

Here I will be writing about my journey into learning Software engineering and Computer science. I will also try to share anything that I learned along the way.
There will be topics I will share my thoughts on, basically whatever seems to have substance or an interesting angle to it.

### Why did I start this blog?

I started this blog as a way to be accountable for my learning. This will enable me to keep track of what I learned and how well did I understand it.

### Main interests and fields of study

This will be priamrily a Backend engineering blog, though it will not shorten the scope of learning.
